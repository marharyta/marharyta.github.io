The airline industry is about to undergo a massive transformation. Thanks to increased onboard connectivity, readily available APIs and recent advances in wearable technology - the travel experience (before, during and after) will never be the same. We live in exciting times and we would like you to join Finnair and Reaktor in ushering in a new era of travel tech.\
Finnair and Reaktor are extremely committed to supporting you in this endeavour. Not only will we provide you with support throughout the event, in the shape of food, entertainment and a few surprises; the top teams will also have the opportunity to put their ideas to the test by setting up a pilot. Once these products have undergone testing with real users, Reaktor will assist you so you can hit the market.\
We are serious about shaking up the industry. Get on board.}
